# Coding Standards — Clean Code Developer (CCD)

_All coding follows the Clean Code Developer (CCD) value system
(clean-code-developer.de). If a rule must be violated, the violation MUST be
justified in the task summary._

## Compliance rule

- The CCD rules below are **binding** for all code in this project.
- If a rule **cannot** be followed in a given task, the agent MUST:
  1. state which rule was violated,
  2. explain why (technical constraint, deadline, platform limitation),
  3. record this justification in the task summary.
- Unjustified violations are not acceptable.

## The CCD value system (all degrees)

### Red degree

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** — no duplicated code/artifacts; extract
   repetitions.
2. **KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)** — prefer the simplest working solution.
3. **Beware of premature optimization** — no optimization without a measured
   bottleneck (profiler); optimize only on customer requirement.
4. **FCoI (Favour Composition over Inheritance)** — prefer composition over
   inheritance; use interfaces/decoupling.
5. **IOSP (Integration Operation Segregation Principle)** — a method contains
   EITHER logic (operation) OR calls to own codebase methods (integration),
   never a mix.
6. **Boy Scout Rule** — leave every code unit better than you found it.
7. **RCA (Root Cause Analysis)** — fix the root cause, not the symptom
   ("five whys").
8. **VCS (Version Control System)** — all code under version control.
9. **Simple refactorings** — apply Extract Method / Rename to clean code smells.
10. **Daily reflection** — reflect daily on whether the rules were followed.

### Orange degree

11. **SLA (Single Level of Abstraction)** — one abstraction level per method.
12. **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)** — one responsibility per class.
13. **SoC (Separation of Concerns)** — separate orthogonal concerns
    (logging, tracing, caching, persistence).
14. **Source code conventions** — consistent naming + minimal comments
    (comment WHY, not WHAT).
15. **Issue tracking** — every open item is written down.
16. **Automated integration tests** — safety net before changing code.
17. **Read, read, read** — continuous learning (books, blogs).
18. **Reviews** — pair programming / code reviews (second pair of eyes).

### Yellow degree

19. **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)** — small, cohesive interfaces.
20. **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)** — depend on abstractions, not
    implementations; inject dependencies (constructor).
21. **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)** — subtypes behave like base type.
22. **Principle of Least Astonishment** — no surprising side effects
    (e.g. no query methods that mutate state).
23. **Information Hiding Principle** — hide internal details behind interfaces.
24. **Automated unit tests** — test single units in isolation.
25. **Mockups** — use test doubles to isolate the system under test.
26. **Code coverage analysis** — measure coverage (aim ~100%, at least 90%).
27. **Participation in professional events** — exchange with other developers.
28. **Complex refactorings** — larger refactorings backed by tests.

### Green degree

29. **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)** — open for extension, closed for
    modification (strategy pattern etc.).
30. **Tell, don't ask** — tell objects what to do; avoid exposing state.
31. **Law of Demeter (LoD)** — "don't talk to strangers"; limit call chains.
32. **CI (Continuous Integration)** — automated build+test on every change.
33. **Static code analysis** — use metrics/analyzers to track changeability.
34. **IoC container** — resolve dependencies via container/locator.
35. **Share experience** — pass on knowledge (talks, blog).
36. **Error measurement** — measure post-delivery defects to improve.

### Blue degree

37. **Design and implementation do not overlap** — architecture describes
    components (black boxes); implementation realizes them.
38. **Implementation reflects design** — physical code organization mirrors
    the architecture.
39. **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)** — implement only clearly required
    functionality; decide as late as possible.
40. **Design before implementation** — think/design before coding.
41. **CD (Continuous Delivery)** — automated, repeatable delivery/install.
42. **Iterative development** — small iterations with customer feedback.
43. **Incremental development** — vertical, executable increments.
44. **Component orientation** — black-box components with separate contracts.
45. **Test first** — specify interfaces/semantics via tests (from the outside
    in).

### White degree

- Completes the circle: continuously apply all of the above; iterate back
  through the degrees to deepen practice.

## Project-specific rules

- **Modular, robust architecture** is a first-class goal (see
  `doc/architecture.md` / `doc/plan.md`). The plugin must be a foundation for
  other VSTs.
- All knowledge sync rules, MCP-first workflow, autopilot and language rules
  from `AGENTS.md` also apply.
